# Flappybird-and-Flappybird-s-friend
Final project
Hello guys, 
Me and my teammate’s name is Jiacheng He (Harry He) and Jie (Jay) Huang. 
Jie is from section 007, Harry is from section 002.
Our final project is a game called Flappy bird and Flappy bird’s friends.
At first, we planned to make a game like Mario, but we were facing a lot of problems such as debugs and all complicated settings such as Mario’s air resistance, and jump inertia etc. So, we changed our plan to make a game like Flappy bird. We followed the tutorial video and added a lot of our own ideas into the game. The process of how we finished the game was really interesting. We enjoyed to create a character from nothing to a vivid creature. At first, we imported and learnt pygame module. Then, we create the structure of the Flappy Bird. Basically, there’s three themes: in-game theme, menu theme, and sprites died theme. Last, we started to finished the game. We added some our own new ideas and new blood into the game:
1.	we tried to change the speed of moving, but there’s some bugs that we can’t fix by now. So, we changed an idea to swap the game mode.
2.	We tried to make the game harder and harder as time goes by, such as the distance between gap goes smaller and smaller and the speed of the game goes faster and faster. It worked. 
3.	We switched the characters and the themes, basically we added more skin and more background to make the game more vivid, so players won’t get bored easily. 

We also encountered some difficulties when we made this game. Such as debug, there’s some bugs that really annoyed:
1.	After we finished the game, when we run it, the character hit the sky then flash back and python killed the program automatically. But Jay fixed it later.
2.	When character died, the drop speed of character is really slow. We changed the FPS to make it faster.
3.	The pipe only can turn 180 degrees, but we can’t fix it by using flip () method. Every time we use flip () method there’s a bug that we don’t know how to fix it. 
4.	Score add 16 points each time the character crosses the pipe. But we didn’t fix it comprehensively, there’s still a bug that when the character crosses the first pipe, the score didn’t plus one.
5.	When character died, pipe disappeared. We use a tomb image instead.

Overall, the game is really successful so far, and we both are really enjoy of debugs and writing code using pycharm.

Hope people are gonna enjoy our game. Thanks for watching!
